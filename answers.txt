2. PHP and Javascript are similar in that they are interpreted languages and do not require a compiler
Both also have dynamic typing which means their variable types can change during runtime. They have some 
similar sytax structures like arithmitic operators, however string opperator differ in each language. 
They are different as Javascript adds dynamic capabilities to the website so that the user can interact with the page.
PHP on the other hand operates in the back-end and processes server requests

3. MVC stands for model, view, and controller. MVC seperates an application into these three components
Each section has different focuses. controller acts as a bridge between view and model, independatly of
data logic. Controller handles buissness logic and incoming requests according to the model componet in order
to then interact with View inorder to create a final output. View componet is what is displayed for the user.
the controller takes data from the model componet to give to the view componet as view only interacts
with the controller. The model componet handles the data-related logic. The controller cannot access 
databases directly, so it requests through the model componet, which then accesses, or posts to the database.
